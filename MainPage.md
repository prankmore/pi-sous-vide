# Introduction #

This project is a combined hardware/software project for turning a slow cooker into a temperature controlled water bath for sous-vide cooking.


# Details #

This project is similar to (and inspired by) a number of other projects using micro-controllers to switch the power on and off to a slow-cooker or rice cooker in order to maintain the temperature at a fixed value.

I have chosen to implement this on the Raspberry Pi device, as it has USB and networking support built in which will allow a simpler build then many other implementations.
It also opens the system up to a much more flexible system.

The system consists of several parts
